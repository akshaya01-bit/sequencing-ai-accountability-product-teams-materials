# Analysis overview

This repository contains research materials (code, synthetic data, and analysis
stubs) for the study:

## Folder structure (analysis-related)

- `data/synthetic/`
  - Synthetic, non-sensitive datasets that mirror the structure of the real
    study data (teams, meetings, agenda items, conditions, outcomes).
- `code/analysis/`
  - Scripts for descriptive statistics, regression models, and power/simulation
    checks, using the synthetic datasets.
- `code/ml/`
  - Scripts and models related to the critical-turn classifier and override
    prediction (to be added as they are developed).
- `fig/`
  - Figures generated by analysis scripts (e.g., power curves, coefficient plots).

The goal is that a reviewer can:
1. Inspect the synthetic datasets.
2. Run the analysis scripts end-to-end on synthetic data.
3. See how the analysis maps onto the models described in the manuscript
   (e.g., outcome variables, condition indicators, clustering).
