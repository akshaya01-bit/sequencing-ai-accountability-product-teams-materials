# Synthetic analysis plan for Study 1

This document explains how the synthetic analysis artifacts in this repository
correspond to the planned analyses described in the manuscript for:

> **Sequencing AI Recommendations and Accountability Practices in Product Teams**

The goal is to give a transparent, non-sensitive proxy for the real data and
models: a reviewer should be able to see the structure of the planned analysis,
run it end-to-end on synthetic data, and inspect the outputs stored in `fig/`.

## 1. Synthetic dataset

**File**

- `data/synthetic/study1_agenda_items_synthetic_full.csv`

**Generated by**

- `code/analysis/generate_synthetic_agenda_data.py`

Each row represents a **single agenda item** discussed in a meeting, for a given
team and week. The generator simulates:

- Multiple teams (T1..T6)
- Multiple meetings per team
- Multiple agenda items per meeting
- Three sequencing conditions:
  - `AI_FIRST`
  - `HUMAN_FIRST`
  - `STATUS_QUO` (baseline)
- An accountability flag (0/1) indicating whether an accountability prompt is present
- Outcomes that mirror the constructs in the manuscript.

### 1.1 Key fields

- `team_id` – team identifier (e.g., T1..T6)
- `meeting_id` – meeting identifier within that team (e.g., T1_M1)
- `week` – simple meeting index used as a week proxy
- `agenda_item_id` – unique agenda item identifier for that meeting
- `sequence_condition` – `{AI_FIRST, HUMAN_FIRST, STATUS_QUO}`
- `accountability` – 0/1 indicator for whether an accountability prompt is present
- `junior_talk_share` – proportion of speaking time accounted for by junior contributors
- `junior_critical_turns` – count of critical/constructive turns from juniors
- `override_ai` – 0/1, whether the team ultimately overrides the AI suggestion
- `psych_safety_score` – 2–5 scale, synthetic proxy for perceived psychological safety

### 1.2 Data-generating assumptions

The synthetic generator encodes simple but interpretable assumptions that align
with the qualitative story in the paper:

- `HUMAN_FIRST` and `accountability = 1` both **increase** `junior_talk_share`
  on average relative to `STATUS_QUO`.
- `AI_FIRST` slightly **reduces** `junior_talk_share` unless accountability is present.
- `override_ai` is more likely when:
  - juniors speak more, and
  - accountability is present.
- `psych_safety_score` is positively related to both accountability and junior talk share.

These are not meant to be empirical claims, only a plausible structure that
matches the hypothesized directions of effect.

## 2. Main regression model on synthetic data

**Script**

- `code/analysis/main_regression_synthetic.py`

This script implements a regression specification that mirrors the primary
model in the manuscript, using `junior_talk_share` as the outcome. The script:
