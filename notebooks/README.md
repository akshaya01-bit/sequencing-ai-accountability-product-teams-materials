This folder will hold exploratory Jupyter notebooks for:

- Inspecting synthetic datasets
- Prototyping regression models and diagnostics
- Visualizing power simulations and key effects

The canonical, re-runnable analysis should live in `code/analysis/` as plain
Python/R scripts; notebooks are for exploration and explanation.
