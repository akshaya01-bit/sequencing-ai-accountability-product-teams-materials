# Sequencing AI Recommendations and Accountability Practices in Product Teams

This repository contains research materials (code, synthetic data, and analysis
notebooks) for the study on how AI recommendation sequencing and accountability
practices shape authority and junior critical participation in product teams.

Structure (planned):

- `code/analysis/` – scripts for statistical analysis and simulations
- `code/ml/`      – models for critical-turn classification, override prediction
- `notebooks/`   – exploratory Jupyter notebooks
- `data/raw/`    – (not committed) raw partner data, if any
- `data/processed/` – derived datasets for analysis
- `data/synthetic/` – synthetic or anonymized datasets for sharing
- `fig/`         – generated figures from code
- `docs/`        – additional documentation, protocols, etc.

At this stage, the repository mainly contains structure; code and data will be
added as they are developed.
